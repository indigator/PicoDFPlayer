# PicoDFPlayer
MicroPython Driver for the DFPlayer (and clones) on Raspberry Pi Pico

This driver implements UART the communication protocol that the DFPlayer use and adds shorthands functions for the most common features for controlling the DFPlayer.

It is also possible to directly send commands to the DFPlayer through the driver, for instance if you want to handle the return values and/or use features that are not implemented as shorthand features.
